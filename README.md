# Hospital-Appointment-Management-System
A web-based system with three roles: Patient, Doctor, and Admin. Patients can register, log in, view doctors, and book appointments. Doctors can register, log in, manage their profiles (specialty, experience, charges), and view their appointments. Admins oversee patients, doctors, and appointments with insights on daily and upcoming schedules.
